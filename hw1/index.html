	<h1>CS184 Homework 1 Writeup</h1>
	<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
	<p>Explanation of rasterizing triangles, including the use of a bounding box, checking triangle winding, and
		determining if a pixel is inside the triangle.</p>

	<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
	<p>Description of the supersampling algorithm, including sample buffer size adjustment, pixel and sub-pixel
		processing, and color averaging for antialiasing effects.</p>

	<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
	<p>Overview of transformations applied to achieve a robot's signature pose in my_robot.svg, involving rotations and
		translations.</p>

	<h2>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
	<p>Explanation of barycentric coordinates for interpolating vertex values within a triangle, illustrated with a
		colored triangle example.</p>

	<h2>Task 5: "Pixel Sampling" for Texture Mapping</h2>
	<p>Comparison of nearest neighbor and bilinear sampling methods for texture mapping, focusing on implementation
		details and visual outcomes.</p>

	<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with Mipmaps for Texture Mapping</h2>
	<p>Explanation of level sampling using mipmaps for texture stretching, including computational details and
		trade-offs among speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power.</p>
